# Rent A Ride

## Introduction -:
  The Rent a Ride project is a vehicle rental management system designed to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to rent vehicles for short-term or long-term use. With the increasing demand for flexible transportation solutions, vehicle rental services have become a practical alternative to owning personal vehicles. This project aims to simplify the process of searching, booking, and managing rental vehicles through a structured and user-friendly system.

  ## Objectives
+ Understanding the fundamentals of version control using Git

+ Learning how to use Git Bash for executing Git commands

+ Creating and managing a repository on GitHub

+ Practicing essential Git commands such as:

       git init

      git add

      git commit
  
      git clone

      git branch

      git merge

Implementing a structured Git workflow and versioning strategy

## Tools & Technologies
  + Git – Distributed version control system

  + Git Bash – Command-line tool for Git operations

  + GitHub – Remote repository hosting and collaboration platform

## Branching Strategy
  + main branch
  
     + Contains stable and production-ready code

  + feature branch

    + Use for developing new features

  + Test branch
    
    + Used for testing the new features 
  + BugFix branch
    + Use for fixing bugs in the feature branch file or in old files after testing

  + Experiment branch
    + Use for experimenting new ideas(UI, feature, styling for website)
    
## Git Workflow

 + Cloning the repository from GitHub

+ Creating a new branch for feature development

+ Making changes and staging files

+ Committing changes with meaningful messages

+ Pushing updates to GitHub

+ Merging branches into the main branch

+ Pulling the latest updates when required
