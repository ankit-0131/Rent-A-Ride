# Working With Git

## Introduction -:
  This repository has been created solely for the purpose of understanding and practicing Git and GitHub concepts in a structured and practical manner. Instead of using abstract examples, a project-like scenario named “Rent-A-Ride” is used to simulate real-world software development workflows.

The repository focuses on hands-on experience with core version control operations such as creating commits, managing branches, handling bug fixes, experimenting with changes, and tracking project history. The emphasis is on learning how Git behaves in realistic development situations rather than on building a fully functional application.

This project serves as a learning and demonstration resource for students and beginners who want to strengthen their understanding of Git through practical usage.

  ## Objectives
+ Understanding the fundamentals of version control using Git

+ Learning how to use Git Bash for executing Git commands

+ Creating and managing a repository on GitHub

+ Practicing essential Git commands such as:

       git init

      git add

      git commit
  
      git clone

      git branch

      git merge

Implementing a structured Git workflow and versioning strategy

## Tools & Technologies
  + Git – Distributed version control system

  + Git Bash – Command-line tool for Git operations

  + GitHub – Remote repository hosting and collaboration platform

## Branching Strateg

Branching is the creation of a separate version of the code to develop features or fix bugs independently. It is used to allow parallel development, prevent errors in the main code, and improve collaboration and code quality.
  + main branch
  
     + Contains stable and production-ready code

  + feature branch

    + Use for developing new features

  + Test branch
    
    + Used for testing the new features 
  + BugFix branch
    + Use for fixing bugs in the feature branch file or in old files after testing

  + Experiment branch
    + Use for experimenting new ideas(UI, feature, styling for website)
    
## Git Workflow

 + Cloning the repository from GitHub

+ Creating a new branch for feature development

+ Making changes and staging files

+ Committing changes with meaningful messages

+ Pushing updates to GitHub

+ Merging branches into the main branch

+ Pulling the latest updates when required
